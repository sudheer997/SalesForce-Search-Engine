# Salesforce Search Engine
Stack Exchange is a popular Q&A website where millions of users ask and answer questions on a wide range of topics. With a focus on questions and answers, the platform serves as a hub for individuals seeking to learn more about a particular subject or solve a problem. Each topic or subject area has its own section within the website, with numerous questions and answers available for users to peruse. While the Stack Exchange website is a valuable resource for users seeking information on a particular subject, it can be difficult for users to find accurate answers to their specific queries. To address this challenge, we developed a search engine that is specifically tailored to the Salesforce dataset that can accurately retrieve the most relevant questions and answers based on a user's query.


## Installation

1. `pip install git+https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git`
2. `pip install streamlit`
3. `pip install uvicorn`

## Dataset

- [Stack Exchange Data Dump (Salesforce)](https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/salesforce.stackexchange.com.7z)

- Training Data: `salesforce.stackexchange.com/Posts.xml`
    - Contains 129,096 unique posts.
- Test Data: `salesforce.stackexchange.com/Test data.csv`
    - Contains 100 unique queries and their corresponding question ids.

## Model
- Model experimentation performed in `Big_Data_Project.ipynb`
- [Embedding Retriever](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/retriever) selected for its ability to retrieve relevant documents from a large corpus of documents
    - Embedding Model: [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

## Start and Initialize ElasticSearch

To initialize ElasticDocumentStore Docker Container
- `uvicorn main:app`

This will
- Serialize NetSuite documentation as JSON documents
- Index the documents in ElasticSearch using BM25 model


## Inference
