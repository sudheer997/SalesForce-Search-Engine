In fact what if your Apex code assumed that the field would be blank if X,Y,Z? If you bypass the validation rule the Apex code would still pass it\\'s tests, but in production when the field was filled in when X,Y,Z the Apex code would break.</p>\\n\\n<p>Edge case to be sure and for the most part we all agree that it\\'s painful when new validation rules break your or past tests so I\\'d bet most people do #2 (disable it) and then when they have time go back and do #1 (clean test code).</p>\\n\\n<p>One thing that can really really help is if you create a \\'TestDataGenerator\\' class that is responsible for creating all of your test data, then you only need to modify the code there as opposed to everywhere. Of course this doesn\\'t help for your unmanaged packages installed off the AppExchange, but at least helps you with your code.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you really want to bypass the validation rules what I typically do is check the user\\'s profile.

All tests use this as a starting point.  If a new validation rule breaks your test you only have to update one place.</p>\\n\\n<p>3) Turn off the Validation Rules for Deployment - Not ideal, but it works.

But here's what I do know: Once your managed package passes the security review and you have it listed as public, you will be granted your own resource space, with the only exception (that I know of) being tabs. This changes if you have an Aloha App and then even tabs are not counted against the org you install in.</p>\\n\\n<p>For example, in a privately listed, managed package that <em>hasn't</em> passed the security review yet, any triggers contained within will share the available resources with other triggers in the org (200 SOQL calls, 100 DML statements, 200K script statements, etc.) Once this managed package passes the review, the package gets its own set of 100 DML statements, 200 SOQL statements, 200K script statements, etc.</p>\\n\\n<p>Although it's difficult to find specific documentation regarding these limit changes after completing the security review, I've been through the review process numerous times and experienced these changes firsthand - along with having confirmation of these changes from premier support.

Can't sort on last modified date, for example. </li>\\n<li>Can't tell what was actually changed (have to manually keep track elsewhere or use the Audit log)</li>\\n<li>Removing from the change set must be done on a single item by item basis.</li>\\n<li>Doesn't support as many components as the Force.com IDE or migration tool.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Conclusion:  Best fit for very small sets of changes done by a single developer on an infrequent basis.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>The Force.com IDE process</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Pros: </p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Easy to see what has changed. </li>\\n<li>Can zip the source and destination prior to deployment.</li>\\n<li>Can synch up with a central repo (e.g., SVN), in theory.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Cons:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>No ability to recall a previous configuration. This is a showstopper\\nfor large deployments.  If you are working on a large project and it\\ncan take you 10+ minutes to build up your deployment (that isn't the\\nproblem, though).  The issue is when that deployment fails your\\nvalidation step, you have to exit out of the deployment UI to fix\\nit, which loses it.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Conclusion: Best fit for small sets of changes, possibly by a team of developers.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Ant migration tool</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Pros:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Scritable.

This is the main reason that MP's are annoying, but there are many others: namespacing is under-implemented, code sharing between packages is annoying, salesforce imposes an odd limit of N (I think 10) namespaces being called per context, the management of package components is much more difficult than non-package, you can only create one managed package per developer org, etc. Basically not designed for the use case you mentioned and should be avoided at all costs if you don't need to hide your source code and/or install via AppExchange or TrialForce.</p>\\n\\n<p>I manage all custom codebases by unmanaged packages with package.xml files, deployed between environments using the (Ant) Force.com Migration Tool with a set of convenience batch files for backing up, timestamping, version control, etc. It's a much easier way to go.

It is a <strong>SObjectDataLoader</strong> class that has methods to serialise and deserialise SObject records including their related records. One of the use cases is to implement a deep clone (rather than the shallow one the platform provides). You can take a look at my blog article about it <a href=\"http://andrewfawcett.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/generic-native-sobject-data-loader/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Basically though it would allow you to do this...</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>Set&lt;Id&gt; myNewRecords = \\n     SObjectDataLoader.deserialise(\\n         SObjectDataLoader.serailise(new Set&lt;Id&gt;{ myExistingRecordId });\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>It uses JSON internally as the format, wrapped in an Apex custom class to maintain the relationships and insertion order of the serialised records.

And you only get 150 <em>total</em> DML statements, so this is a precious resource. A nice approach to upserting is to use lists of SObjects containing various types of SObjects. For example, the following is possible:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>List&lt;SObject&gt; so = new List&lt;SObject&gt;();\\n\\nfor(Lead l : leads)\\n   so.add(l);\\n\\nfor(Contact c : contacts)\\n   so.add(c);\\n\\nfor(Account a : accounts)\\n   so.add(a);\\n\\nfor(User u : users)\\n   so.add(u);\\n\\nDatabase.update(so);\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>In this design, all of your trigger code should reside in classes and your triggers pass in an SObject map to be appended to when down in the class code. The trigger code might look like this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>Map&lt;Id, SObject&gt; objectsToUpdate = new Map&lt;Id, SObject&gt;();\\nTriggerClass1.processTrigger(Trigger.new, Trigger.newMap, Trigger.old, Trigger.oldMap, objectsToUpdate);\\nTriggerClass2.processTrigger(Trigger.new, Trigger.newMap, Trigger.old, Trigger.oldMap, objectsToUpdate);\\n\\nif(objectsToUpdate.size() &gt; 0)\\n   Database.update(objectsToUpdate.values());\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Aggregating your DML should feel a bit less awkward than implementing a special test-method shutoff valve.

Go to setup->monitor->jobs->scheduled jobs, and you\\'ll see a list of all scheduled jobs. For apex classes that were scheduled through the \\'Schedule Apex\\' button in setup->develop->apex classes, you\\'ll see a \\'Manage\\' link next to the job. Click that and you\\'ll see the class name associated with that job.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Option 2 - Test Delete Schedulable Classes</h2>\\n\\n<p>However, it turns out the metadata api is kind enough to return the id of the CronTrigger records associated with an apex class if you try and delete it.</p>\\n\\n<p>First you\\'ll need to get a list of all schedulable apex classes then you org and then try and delete them with the metadata api. If say there was just one, <code>MySchedulableClass</code> you would you would have the following <code>destructiveChanges.xml</code></p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\\n&lt;Package xmlns=\"http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata\"&gt;\\n    &lt;types&gt;\\n        &lt;members&gt;MySchedulableClass&lt;/members&gt;\\n        &lt;name&gt;ApexClass&lt;/name&gt;\\n    &lt;/types&gt;\\n    &lt;version&gt;41.0&lt;/version&gt;\\n&lt;/Package&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>If you do a test deployment, you\\'ll get an error like the following which includes the crontrigger ids (they start with <code>08e</code>)</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>BUILD FAILED\\n/Users/yourname/ant/sfse/build.xml:95: The following error occurred while executing this line:\\n/Users/yourname/ant/sfse/build.xml:55: \\n*********** DEPLOYMENT FAILED ***********\\nRequest ID: 0AfXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\\n\\nAll Component Failures:\\n1.  classes/MySchedulableClass.cls -- Error: This apex class is referenced elsewhere in salesforce.com.

This Schedulable class is in use. : Apex Class.\\n\\n*********** DEPLOYMENT FAILED ***********\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Then it\\'s just a matter of searching those errors for the id of the particular <code>CronTrigger</code> you\\'re interested in and you\\'ll have your answer.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>CAVEAT</strong> I expect this approach won\\'t work for schedulable classes that are part of a managed package since you won\\'t be able to delete those with the metadata api, but who knows, worth trying.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Option 3 - Correlate with <code>AsyncApexJob</code> Table</h2>\\n\\n<p>Based on @michael\\'s <a href=\"https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/a/47067/594\">answer</a>. In most cases schedulable jobs will start a batch job. If that\\'s the case you can look at the last fired date for the scheduled jobs list and try and find the corresponding job in the <code>AsyncApexJob</code> table based on the created date for the <code>AsyncApexJob</code>, then you can inspect the <code>ApexClassId</code> column.</p>\\n'},\n",

For example: Apex-Lang\\'s <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/apex-lang/source/browse/trunk/eclipse-project/src/classes/ArrayUtils.cls\">ArrayUtils.qsort</a> I have made it a requirement in the past that all sorting outside of SOQL should be implemented using this interface. Why? because of the interface you can sort any object by its properties in a completely predictable manner, every time. No multiple dictionary mutation funny business. It cleanly provides a very clear re-usable approach to sorting objects, much like the Comparator interface in Java.</p>\\n\\n<p>What are interfaces not good at? I have never had good luck implementing an interface as a controller for a visualforce page. Why? Because visualforce requires getter/setter methods in order to access properties and the idea of having to define each and every getter setter and then implement it defeats the purpose of re-usability. </p>\\n\\n<p>This brings us to abstract/virtual classes. </p>\\n\\n<p>Abstract/Virtual Classes:<br>\\nIn Apex abstract classes are great for creating re-usable patterns for implementing controllers (among other things). If you ever implement a visualforce page in a site you\\'ll find that if there is any uncaught runtime error the user will only see a stanard permission exception page (hell to debug).\\nInstead of try catching every single contructor or initalize/action method you can write an abstract class that implements the various constructors and then use a one line method in the child class: (psuedo code)</p>\\n\\n<pre><code> public abstract class B{\\n     sObject sobj;\\n     public B(){}\\n     public B(ApexPages.StandardController r){\\n         try{\\n            this.sobj = r.getRecord();\\n            //do something standard\\n         }\\n         catch(Exception e){\\n           ApexPages.addMessage(new ApexPages.Message(ApexPages.Severity.ERROR, e.getMessage()));\\n         }\\n     }\\n }\\n class A extends B{\\n     public A(ApexPages.StandardController r){\\n          super(r);\\n     }\\n }\\n</code></pre>\\n'}],\n",

       "   'body': '<p>My name is Adam Torman and I\\'m a platform product manager at salesforce.com responsible for profiles and permission sets. </p>\\n\\n<p>I get this question quite a bit and I wish there was an \\'easy\\' button to push that could give you the information your looking for. </p>\\n\\n<p>The reality is that the concept of \\'easy\\' doesn\\'t scale nearly as well as a user\\'s profile or permission set. </p>\\n\\n<p>Take an org with 100 custom objects, each object with approximately 50 fields. Add on average 2 page layouts per object with a record type a piece. Include 10 apps, 100 apex classes and 100 visual force pages.  For any given profile or permission set, that means there are 11,000 permissions that can be configured ((100*6) + (100*50*2) + (100*2) + (200)) with an almost infinite number of possible combinations. </p>\\n\\n<p>And that\\'s not even everything that a profile can contain! Add to that 10 profiles you want to combine and compare across 100 users with 20 add-on permission sets and you have a proverbial needle in the haystack.</p>\\n\\n<p>So when it comes to administering profiles and permission sets, it\\'s really about finding the right tool for the job.  There are many tools available to manage these profiles and permission sets, but no single tool I would recommend because every tool begins with a fundamental question, \"what do I want to know\" or \"what do I want to do\"?</p>\\n\\n<p>Examples of questions I frequently hear include:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>Who has Modify All Data?</p></li>\\n<li><p>Does Sam Bradley have the right to click on this tab or view that Visualforce page?</p></li>\\n<li><p>What\\'s different between Sam Bradley and Mike Liescher?</p></li>\\n<li><p>What\\'s different between the Standard User and the Basic profiles?</p></li>\\n<li><p>What\\'s different between the PTO Manager and PTO Administrator permission sets?</p></li>\\n<li><p>How can I assign this permission set to 100 new users?</p></li>\\n<li><p>How can I remove the Modify All Data permission from any users with the Basic Profile or have North American Managers in their title</p></li>\\n<li><p>How can I automate the assignment of the API Enabled permission set anytime a user becomes a manager and remove it if it no longer applies?</p></li>\\n<li><p>How can I disable the View All Data permission from all profiles, add it to a single permission set, and assign it to all users who originally had the profile with the permission?</p></li>\\n<li><p>How can I organize my permission sets the same way I organize my business or distribute apps to people?</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Each question maps to a specific task that I am performing as an administrator. Now combine each task with the concept that each user, profile, and permission set can contain an infinite number of permission and settings combinations and you have the need to find the right tool for the right job to answer the right question. And each task may map to a different tool or API that can be used to answer it. </p>\\n\\n<p>There are some great resources to help answer specific questions.

Mike Chale\\'s comment about using the ANT Migration Tool is another manfiestation of this. </p></li>\\n<li><p>There are some other great open resources that take the MdAPI XML and parses it to show differences like Quick Diff ( <a href=\"http://www.quickdiff.com/\">http://www.quickdiff.com/</a> ), or Model Metrics Diff Dog - Setting up and using DiffDog for Salesforce.com ( <a href=\"http://www.modelmetrics.com/tomgersic/setting-up-and-using-diffdog-for-salesforce-com-deployment-validation/\">http://www.modelmetrics.com/tomgersic/setting-up-and-using-diffdog-for-salesforce-com-deployment-validation/</a> )</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>There are also some great AppExchange Packages including:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>The Permissioner by Arkus: ( <a href=\"https://sites.secure.force.com/appexchange/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000008XYMlEAO\">https://sites.secure.force.com/appexchange/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000008XYMlEAO</a> )</p></li>\\n<li><p>Snapshot by Dreamfactory: ( <a href=\"https://sites.secure.force.com/appexchange/listingDetail?listingId=a0N300000016cejEAA#\">https://sites.secure.force.com/appexchange/listingDetail?listingId=a0N300000016cejEAA#</a> )</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>The key part here really is identifying what you want to compare and why. The why part is pretty important since once you know how profiles are different, you\\'ll want to do something with that information.</p>\\n\\n<p>Hope this helps some!

If your Package ever even <strong>refers</strong> to the <code>RecordType</code> API object, such as in a Utility method that you might use for your EE/UE customers for getting all active/available record types by name/id, your package will be excluded from GE/PE orgs. <strong>However</strong>, use of the DescribeSObjectResult <code>getRecordTypeInfos()</code> family of methods does <em>not</em> exclude your package from GE/PE. So in summary:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>use of <code>Schema.RecordTypeInfo</code> IS allowed</li>\\n<li>use of <code>RecordType</code> object is NOT allowed. </li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li><p>Force.com Sites: again, any hard-coded reference to the <code>Site</code> or <code>SiteDomain</code> objects in Apex will exclude your package from GE/PE orgs. However, Dynamic SOQL, i.e. <code>Database.query(\\'select Id from Site limit 1\\')</code> is a good way to get around this, <strong><em>as it moves the feature detection from compile-time to run-time</em></strong>. I would assume that, as with <code>RecordTypeInfo</code>, use of the <code>System.Site</code> Apex class methods would <em>not</em> exclude you from GE/PE.</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Furthermore, you might think that deprecating a method or part of your code that uses a not-allowed API object would allow successive versions to be allowed in GE/PE. Nope!</p>\\n\\n<p>Also, a couple of features not supported in either GE or PE orgs not mentioned in Jordan\\'s answer:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Record Types</li>\\n<li>Custom Report Types</li>\\n</ul>\\n'}],\n",

The crypto was very straightforward, but the only way I was able to break the plaintext into 128-bit (16-byte) blocks was by base64 encoding it, twiddling bits, then base64 decoding the result. The same for combining ciphertext blocks into the final output.</p>\\n\\n<p>Anyway - here is the code. It works for a bunch of test vectors that attempt to hit various cases in terms of numbers of blocks and amount of data in the last block, including your 54 byte example plaintext. It is a bit messy and, since it is stepping through most of the plaintext byte by byte, <strong>horribly inefficient</strong>, with about 10 script statements per byte of plaintext. <strike>You would not be able to encrypt more than about 20k of plaintext before you ran up against the script statement governor limit.</strike> <em>I have no idea how this will perform under CPU time limits. Would be interesting to find out!</em></p>\\n\\n<p>I\\'m posting it to show a solution as best I can see it, and to solicit better approaches, if they exist.

If you have 10,001 Account records in your org, this is impossible without some way of breaking it up. So in the start() method, you define the query you're going to use in this batch context: 'select Id from Account'. Then the execute() method runs, but only receives a relatively short list of records (default 200). Within the execute(), everything runs in its own transactional context, which means almost all of the governor limits only apply to that block. Thus each time execute() is run, you are allowed 150 queries and 50,000 DML rows and so on. When that execute() is complete, a new one is instantiated with the next group of 200 Accounts, with a brand new set of governor limits. Finally the finish() method wraps up any loose ends as necessary, like sending a status email.</p>\\n\\n<p>So your batch that runs against 10,000 Accounts will actually be run in 50 separate execute() transactions, each of which only has to deal with 200 Accounts. Governor limits still apply, but only to each transaction, along with a separate set of limits for the batch as a whole.</p>\\n\\n<p>Disadvantages of batch processing: </p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>It runs asynchronously, which can make it hard to troubleshoot without some coded debugging, logging, and persistent stateful reporting. It also means that it's queued to run, which may cause delays in starting.</li>\\n<li>There's a limit of 5 batches in play at any time, which makes it tricky to start batches from triggers unless you are checking limits.</li>\\n<li>If you need access within execute() to some large part of the full dataset being iterated, this is not available. Each execution only has access to whatever is passed to it, although you can persist class variables by implementing Database.stateful.</li>\\n<li>There is still a (fairly large) limit on total Heap size for the entire batch run, which means that some very complex logic may run over, and need to be broken into separate batches. </li>\\n</ul>\\n\"},\n",

To do this, use WSDL2Apex with the Partner WSDL to generate some Stubs within your package Development org.

Of course you could go the \"easy route\" if you don\\'t need this Describe Tabs information ever again, and just store your Web Tab\\'s tab Id in a single text field on your Custom Setting. Forgive me for over-architecting, it\\'s my job :)</p>\\n\\n<p>3) At run time, in your Visualforce Page\\'s Apex controller, access the stored values in the Custom Setting by reassembling your String, deserializing it into an Object (or just getting the desired Web Tab\\'s Id from a stored field in your Custom Setting if you went the easy route). <strong>Because this Tab is not going away from your Managed Package, the tab\\'s Id will remain stable</strong> <strong><em>within a given customer\\'s org.</em></strong> So it\\'s fine to store and access it this way.</p>\\n'}],\n",

Another possibility is to dedicate one or more configuration sprints ahead of the development effort, adjusting the team along the way. But this has the disadvantage of resetting your velocity measurement (burn down) where sprint planning with story point estimates gets unclear (or the per-sprint story point capacity of the team).</p>\\n\\n<p>So I would consider having a dedicated configuration team member or perhaps even a separate team (or person), even if the cadence differs from the development team.

We can then create a session, set the relevant cookie and redirect the browser to the originally requested page.</p>\\n\\n<p>Note that SAML can be implemented in an \\'IdP-initiated\\' configuration, in which case, the user requests some page at the IdP, in response to which it generates the assertion and POSTs it \\'unsolicited\\' to Salesforce. This process also sets a persistent cookie, so subsequent login requests are redirected via the IdP.</p>\\n\\n<p>For troubleshooting, it is possible to force the use of the Salesforce login page rather than SAML by specifying the <code>login</code> query parameter - very handy in case of a misconfiguration!</p>\\n\\n<p>If SAML is not configured, or the request was to a non-My Domain URL, then a login page is shown. We examine the user agent header to serve an appropriately formatted login page for the device, although this can be overridden via the <code>display</code> query parameter:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>page</code> Full-page authorization screen (default).</li>\\n<li><code>popup</code> Compact dialog optimized for modern web browser popup windows.</li>\\n<li><code>touch</code> Mobile-optimized dialog designed for modern smartphones, such as Android and iPhone.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>For example, try <a href=\"https://login.salesforce.com/?display=touch\">https://login.salesforce.com/?display=touch</a> on a desktop browser.</p>\\n\\n<p>If the request was to a <a href=\"https://login.salesforce.com/help/doc/en/package_branding.htm\">Trialforce branded</a> domain (i.e. mycompany.cloudforce.com), then the login page is branded appropriately, otherwise the standard Salesforce login page is shown.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, when the user submits the login page with their credentials, Salesforce looks up the user from the username. If Delegated Authentication (DA) is configured for this org and user, we send the supplied password to the configured DA endpoint for verification, otherwise we verify the password against the hash we have on record for that user. Either way, if the password is successfully verified, we create a session, issue the cookie, and redirect the user to the requested page.</p>\\n'}],\n",

But it\\'s such a common need you\\'ll just get in the habit of putting it everywhere.</p>\\n\\n<p>If your logic warrants it, I recommend building in more than an on-off switch: build in a number of \"switch off\" levels so you can gracefully step down to the level of logic you need when data loading. It will cost you almost no more up-front but you\\'ll be thankful. If using custom settings you\\'ll want something compatible with CONTAINS checks. e.g. \"123456789\" = all checks are on. But removing \"9\" causes something like all email and chatter notifications to be disabled, \"8\" disables something like \"soft\" validation rules, and all of those have checks like</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>if (Label.myLabel.contains(\\'9\\')) { // do my stuff\\n\\nIF(CONTAINS($Label.myLabel, \"8\"), [fire my semi-optional user-facing validation rule], [auto-pass my rule])\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The disadvantage with custom labels of course is that they will have system-wide effects for all users, which won\\'t work for many customers. In those cases, you are probably better off using a single named user or role or profile in these rules (either dedicated API account, or a sys admin user/role/profile) and doing the same type of check against something like username or role AND then using the contents of something like user alias if you want granular on/off control.</p>\\n'},\n",

The good news is that  whereas previously, you couldn\\'t import the WSDL directly (due to naming conflicts), that seems to be fixed; the importer automatically appends <code>_x</code> to problematic names, so (for example) <code>merge</code> becomes <code>merge_x</code>.  </p>\\n\\n<p>When you import the WSDL, you\\'ll have to choose names for the generated Apex classes (one per namespace), for my example code below, I chose class names as follows:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>urn:sobject.partner.soap.sforce.com</code> -> <code>PartnerSObject</code></li>\\n<li><code>urn:fault.partner.soap.sforce.com</code> -> <code>PartnerAPIFaults</code></li>\\n<li><code>urn:partner.soap.sforce.com</code> -> <code>PartnerAPI</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>You will also need to add your salesforce server to the remote site settings to allow soap callouts.</p>\\n\\n<p>With those preliminaries out of the way, here\\'s some basic code to prove it works.

The crypto was very straightforward, but the only way I was able to break the plaintext into 128-bit (16-byte) blocks was by base64 encoding it, twiddling bits, then base64 decoding the result. The same for combining ciphertext blocks into the final output.</p>\\n\\n<p>Anyway - here is the code. It works for a bunch of test vectors that attempt to hit various cases in terms of numbers of blocks and amount of data in the last block, including your 54 byte example plaintext. It is a bit messy and, since it is stepping through most of the plaintext byte by byte, <strong>horribly inefficient</strong>, with about 10 script statements per byte of plaintext. <strike>You would not be able to encrypt more than about 20k of plaintext before you ran up against the script statement governor limit.</strike> <em>I have no idea how this will perform under CPU time limits. Would be interesting to find out!</em></p>\\n\\n<p>I\\'m posting it to show a solution as best I can see it, and to solicit better approaches, if they exist.

       "   'body': \"<p>A Batch class allows you to define a single job that can be broken up into manageable chunks that will be processed separately.</p>\\n\\n<p>One example is if you need to make a field update to every Account in your organization. If you have 10,001 Account records in your org, this is impossible without some way of breaking it up. So in the start() method, you define the query you're going to use in this batch context: 'select Id from Account'. Then the execute() method runs, but only receives a relatively short list of records (default 200). Within the execute(), everything runs in its own transactional context, which means almost all of the governor limits only apply to that block. Thus each time execute() is run, you are allowed 150 queries and 50,000 DML rows and so on. When that execute() is complete, a new one is instantiated with the next group of 200 Accounts, with a brand new set of governor limits. Finally the finish() method wraps up any loose ends as necessary, like sending a status email.</p>\\n\\n<p>So your batch that runs against 10,000 Accounts will actually be run in 50 separate execute() transactions, each of which only has to deal with 200 Accounts. Governor limits still apply, but only to each transaction, along with a separate set of limits for the batch as a whole.</p>\\n\\n<p>Disadvantages of batch processing: </p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>It runs asynchronously, which can make it hard to troubleshoot without some coded debugging, logging, and persistent stateful reporting. It also means that it's queued to run, which may cause delays in starting.</li>\\n<li>There's a limit of 5 batches in play at any time, which makes it tricky to start batches from triggers unless you are checking limits.</li>\\n<li>If you need access within execute() to some large part of the full dataset being iterated, this is not available. Each execution only has access to whatever is passed to it, although you can persist class variables by implementing Database.stateful.</li>\\n<li>There is still a (fairly large) limit on total Heap size for the entire batch run, which means that some very complex logic may run over, and need to be broken into separate batches. </li>\\n</ul>\\n\"},\n",

Forgive me for over-architecting, it\\'s my job :)</p>\\n\\n<p>3) At run time, in your Visualforce Page\\'s Apex controller, access the stored values in the Custom Setting by reassembling your String, deserializing it into an Object (or just getting the desired Web Tab\\'s Id from a stored field in your Custom Setting if you went the easy route). <strong>Because this Tab is not going away from your Managed Package, the tab\\'s Id will remain stable</strong> <strong><em>within a given customer\\'s org.</em></strong> So it\\'s fine to store and access it this way.</p>\\n'}],\n",

Another possibility is to dedicate one or more configuration sprints ahead of the development effort, adjusting the team along the way. But this has the disadvantage of resetting your velocity measurement (burn down) where sprint planning with story point estimates gets unclear (or the per-sprint story point capacity of the team).</p>\\n\\n<p>So I would consider having a dedicated configuration team member or perhaps even a separate team (or person), even if the cadence differs from the development team.

If Delegated Authentication (DA) is configured for this org and user, we send the supplied password to the configured DA endpoint for verification, otherwise we verify the password against the hash we have on record for that user.

It will cost you almost no more up-front but you\\'ll be thankful. If using custom settings you\\'ll want something compatible with CONTAINS checks. e.g. \"123456789\" = all checks are on. But removing \"9\" causes something like all email and chatter notifications to be disabled, \"8\" disables something like \"soft\" validation rules, and all of those have checks like</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>if (Label.myLabel.contains(\\'9\\')) { // do my stuff\\n\\nIF(CONTAINS($Label.myLabel, \"8\"), [fire my semi-optional user-facing validation rule], [auto-pass my rule])\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The disadvantage with custom labels of course is that they will have system-wide effects for all users, which won\\'t work for many customers. In those cases, you are probably better off using a single named user or role or profile in these rules (either dedicated API account, or a sys admin user/role/profile) and doing the same type of check against something like username or role AND then using the contents of something like user alias if you want granular on/off control.</p>\\n'},\n",

The good news is that  whereas previously, you couldn\\'t import the WSDL directly (due to naming conflicts), that seems to be fixed; the importer automatically appends <code>_x</code> to problematic names, so (for example) <code>merge</code> becomes <code>merge_x</code>.  </p>\\n\\n<p>When you import the WSDL, you\\'ll have to choose names for the generated Apex classes (one per namespace), for my example code below, I chose class names as follows:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>urn:sobject.partner.soap.sforce.com</code> -> <code>PartnerSObject</code></li>\\n<li><code>urn:fault.partner.soap.sforce.com</code> -> <code>PartnerAPIFaults</code></li>\\n<li><code>urn:partner.soap.sforce.com</code> -> <code>PartnerAPI</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>You will also need to add your salesforce server to the remote site settings to allow soap callouts.</p>\\n\\n<p>With those preliminaries out of the way, here\\'s some basic code to prove it works.

It\\'s more of a collective of us though now since the Social Enterprise vision has kicked it up a couple notches. Sorry I didn\\'t come on this thread sooner. </p>\\n\\n<p>Basically all the information is right in different degrees as laid out above. </p>\\n\\n<p>Historically during beta and before Radian6 was acquired, we had custom objects the Social_Media_Persona__c object and the Social_Media_Post__c object. Since the acquisition we\\'ve started to rebuild these objects, SocialPost and SocialPersona in core to make them standard objects. There was a hiccup at one point though around exposing these newly established objects via API to ensure terms of service compliance around the data being stored in the objects. Our intention is to make them standard and generally available. We haven\\'t locked in on a release date yet though. </p>\\n\\n<p>At the present time to see them from the UI layer you\\'ll need to enable Social Accounts and Contacts. Then as a very sharp contributor above pointed out the Social Persona will be created in support of any Contact you make a social connection with (by clicking the Facebook or Twitter icon for instance). The idea here is the Persona as a child object of the Contact will contain the varying and different values we\\'re able to acquire through various means, such as Social Key (Data.com) or the Social Hub (Marketing Cloud) or through your manual connection.</p>\\n\\n<p>You\\'ll require special permissions to gain access to those objects via the API because their not completely done and there will be changes to them over the next several major releases of Salesforce.com. So of course I\\'d caution you against creating any customization on those objects that runs too deep (beyond prototype) until such time as they are officially Generally Available and published in the API and aren\\'t controlled by special permission access. (expect schema and column changes)</p>\\n\\n<p>To achieve OP\\'s use case I would suggest the use of the Persona object. The basic business justification behind that is because most of the internal social products are aligning around the use of the Persona object. As such using it will ensure if you bring any other social processes online you\\'ll have a means to control / reduce / eliminate duplicate social contacts. I\\'d also suggest taking a closer look at the use of the custom object as the parent. Person Accounts are the generally used B2C approach. I suspect though with our companies foray into the social enterprise, to see some investment and attention around the B2C space in the releases to come at some point in the future and I would imagine some attention to improving \"person accounts\". By hitching your wagon to the Person Account you are more or less increasing the probability you\\'ll be able to leverage B2C advantages and functionality for free (figuratively from a programming analogy) that are added to the platform as they\\'re developed.</p>\\n\\n<p>I should point something out though about the present schema; there is a native relationship control field called the \"Who\" field which establishes a parent look-up. The fact that this is currently limited to Leads and Contacts only may pose a slight challenge for you a little further down the line if you introduce additional social processes or start using Social Contacts. You may encounter a situation where a Contact w/ Persona could contain duplicate Persona and Custom Object data all which is really the same real social person. You\\'ll want to mind that for data hygiene reasons.</p>\\n\\n<p>I think it\\'s a great feature request though to perhaps not require the Persona to need to be parented by a lead or contract and open the ability up for it to be parented by custom objects for the use case you have outlined. Further we should consider custom search and match logic to ensure that once you\\'ve instantiated this custom relationship that you can dictate to any other social process where we should be looking to potentially prevent duplicate creation (or at least a good effort based on the objects and fields you specify to look for unique social ids like a Twitter Author\\'s Unique ID). </p>\\n\\n<p>Hope this helps.. </p>\\n\\n<p>Edit: to gain access to Social Post / Persona via API / Apex you\\'ll need to contact support@radian6.com and again caution, they are not in a complete state, there will be changes to the relationships in the objects and the standard fields they contain, so I wouldn\\'t do more than prototype on them until they are locked in on a G.A. state or at the very least don\\'t tightly couple your apps to them.

       "   'body': '<p>We did something similar at Dashcord specifically for mail merge, with the goal of getting a more full-featured templating engine. We did indeed do pretty much what you describe - lots of regex. A few pointers you may find helpful:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>as with any regex work, make sure you do LOTS of testing. If users are able to create their own templates, your regexes need to be very solid to tolerate all the various typos / whitespace combos / non-conforming merge markup that your code will see.</li>\\n<li>you may find it convenient for your needs to use the core EmailTemplate object as a backend data store for your merge templates. That has some advantages: you can use the (very basic) Salesforce template builder as an editor, you can reuse existing templates (if applicable), and you get a (basic) data model that may meet your needs (folders, subject, text + html version). Disadvantages are that you can\\'t natively extend the data model, and also Salesforce does some somewhat undocumented \"magic\" on \"{!\" tags that you may not expect (replacing tags it considers to be invalid, for one).</li>\\n<li>if you\\'re not familiar with the excellent <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/apex-lang/\" rel=\"nofollow\">apex-lang</a> library, it provides an ideal query engine for the types of dynamic queries you\\'ll need to make. For instance, it allows you to pass in a SFDC ID and a <code>Set&lt;String&gt;</code> of fields, and give you the object plus requested fields.</li>\\n<li>I don\\'t think you\\'re going to find that the core Apex API gives you a much more convenient way of doing merges than you describe. The core template merge isn\\'t openly exposed. You might investigate VisualForce templates and/or dynamic VisualForce, but I\\'m pretty sure neither will get you where you need to go.</li>\\n<li>in the (somewhat unlikely, but possible) event that your templating engine needs to match on patterns that include line breaks, be aware that Apex doesn\\'t expose Java\\'s DOTALL flag. This can make matching long patterns that include line breaks and/or funky characters a bit of an exercise in regex hackery.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Hope that gives you some ideas.</p>\\n'}],\n",

The fact that it is working some of the time is a surprise to me.</p>\\n\\n<p>Generally, unless you have explicitly queried for fields on a related record, a reference using the relationship name will return null or throw a 'field not queried' exception. In your case, if you want to refer to the field <code>ms.Case__r.BusinessHoursId</code>, you would need to insert the <code>ms</code> record, then query for that same record:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>insert ms;\\nms = [select Id, Case__r.BusinessHoursId from Milestone__c where Id = :ms.Id];\\nSystem.debug(ms.Case__r.BusinessHoursId); //should give you the right value\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Added as explanation:</p>\\n\\n<p>The lookup field itself (<code>ms.Case__c</code>) can be thought of as simply a text/Id field with a primitive String value in it. The relationship name, <code>ms.Case__r</code> actually refers to an entire object that is sort of stuck onto the object you queried (ms) as an object attribute. You can use additional relationships to retrieve more related objects, such as <code>ms.Case__r.Account.Name</code>, in which you can think of <code>ms.Case__r.Account</code> as being an entire object based on the field <code>ms.Case__r.AccountId</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p>In a trigger, all fields on the triggering object are available, but no fields on related objects are available, so one of the most common Trigger patterns involves collecting related record Ids and querying for them separately from the triggering records. In most other contexts, only the fields you query for will be in the object record you're working with. In the case of your <code>getNumMinutesTaken</code> method, you are assuming that the milestone record you're passed was queried on fields <code>Case__r.BusinessHoursId</code>, <code>Start__c</code> and <code>CompletionDatetime__c</code>. You're not querying for or referring to <code>Case__c</code>, since you don't need to know the actual Id of the Case, just some fields on the Case object.</p>\\n\"},\n",

The Metadata Toolkit gives you the flexibility of editing raw XML files, allowing you to copy only the information you want to.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let\\'s take a look at using the Metadata Toolkit, since it\\'s fairly easy to use, and has reasonable documentation.</p>\\n\\n<p>First, I create a package.xml file that has the following content:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\\n&lt;Package xmlns=\"http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata\"&gt;\\n    &lt;types&gt;\\n        &lt;members&gt;Lead.CurrentGenerators__c&lt;/members&gt;\\n        &lt;name&gt;CustomField&lt;/name&gt;\\n    &lt;/types&gt;\\n    &lt;types&gt;\\n        &lt;members&gt;Admin&lt;/members&gt;\\n        &lt;name&gt;Profile&lt;/name&gt;\\n    &lt;/types&gt;\\n    &lt;version&gt;29.0&lt;/version&gt;\\n&lt;/Package&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Here, I specifically request a single field and a single profile. The results of this export gives me:</p>\\n\\n<p>objects/Lead.object</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\\n&lt;CustomObject xmlns=\"http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata\"&gt;\\n    &lt;fields&gt;\\n        &lt;fullName&gt;CurrentGenerators__c&lt;/fullName&gt;\\n        &lt;externalId&gt;false&lt;/externalId&gt;\\n        &lt;label&gt;Current Generator(s)&lt;/label&gt;\\n        &lt;length&gt;100&lt;/length&gt;\\n        &lt;required&gt;false&lt;/required&gt;\\n        &lt;trackFeedHistory&gt;false&lt;/trackFeedHistory&gt;\\n        &lt;type&gt;Text&lt;/type&gt;\\n        &lt;unique&gt;false&lt;/unique&gt;\\n    &lt;/fields&gt;\\n&lt;/CustomObject&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>profiles/Admin.profile</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\\n&lt;Profile xmlns=\"http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata\"&gt;\\n    &lt;fieldPermissions&gt;\\n        &lt;editable&gt;true&lt;/editable&gt;\\n        &lt;field&gt;Lead.CurrentGenerators__c&lt;/field&gt;\\n        &lt;readable&gt;true&lt;/readable&gt;\\n    &lt;/fieldPermissions&gt;\\n    &lt;userLicense&gt;Salesforce&lt;/userLicense&gt;\\n&lt;/Profile&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>If I change \"editable\" to false, and deploy this change to another organization with the same field (or, even if the field does not exist), then the <em>only</em> change that would occur is that the single field level security setting would change-- all other fields, objects, and other permissions would remain intact.</p>\\n\\n<p>This feature is often used to deploy security changes that are scoped out in a Sandbox. You can be as selective as you\\'d like to be, even down to just a single field\\'s permissions. In this manner, you can choose which permissions you\\'d like to deploy. Also, you could choose to manually edit the XML files before deployment to deploy different sets of field level security permissions within the same package. They do not need to be a fully rectangular matrix. For example, you could build a deployment like this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>           Field 1 Field 2 Field 3\\nProfile 1  Edit    -       Read\\nProfile 2  Read    Edit    -\\nProfile 3  Edit    Edit    Edit\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>In this case, two field level security settings will not change (Profile 1\\'s Field 2 security, and Profile 2\\'s Field 3 security), while the other settings will be as specified. Hopefully this answer will help clear up the confusion of the other answers that have been posted to this question.</p>\\n\\n<h2>TL;DR version</h2>\\n\\n<p>Only settings explicitly mentioned in a change set or metadata API xml file will be modified. One should not think of this as an \"overwrite\", but instead a \"selective edit.\"</p>\\n'},\n",

Your code should only perform a query, update, etc once per invocation and should not be dependent on the number of records in your batch.

Perhaps one of the records would fail in the batch due to a validation rule or some other problem and prevent all the updates from occurring? If that is the case look into some exception handling around the update (see the <a href=\"http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/Content/apex_dml_update.htm#kanchor659\" rel=\"nofollow\">example</a> at the bottom of the page for inspiration) and perhaps the optAllorNone property as a better solution than having the update within a loop.</p>\\n'},\n",

The flow would then create the contract, and take the multiselect checkboxes and add detail records to a junction object (junction between Products and Contracts).  Flow cannot do this, so I have flow do an Assignment step to store the multiselect fields in a variable.  It is a bunch of Ids separated by semicolons.  This is saved in a long text field on the contract that doesnt appear on the layout.  I then wrote an after insert Apex Trigger for the Contract object that takes the text field, parses it for Ids that are stored in a list, then are inserted as detail records.  Voila!

Now that you have all of the possible choices one could pick in the sOC, after the dynamic choices are made, you need to run a loop to match the choices made to the sOC, using the sOC as the loop controller.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here comes the cool part. In your loop, your first step will be to have a decision step to compare the results from the dynamic choice step to the object you\\'ve created in the loop step (I would have called it sOCObjectContainer). Don\\'t forget, you need to use the sOCObjectContainer.<strong>Id</strong> as the value to compare to the values of the dynamic choice variable. Once you get a positive match, leading into the further steps in the the loop, you need to assign the values of the sOCObjectContainer into a new sObject collection. Something like \"sOCObjectsToSave\". You can also assign values to another variable for a confimation page, which you can show the user before the final save of sOCObjectsToSave is made (and after your loop is finished). Also don\\'t forget, the other side of the decision to match the dynamic choices (No Matched decision path) has to go back to the loop to have it continue on no match. </p>\\n\\n<p>I hope that makes sense and helps. </p>\\n\\n<p>Scott </p>\\n'}],\n",

       "   'body': '<p>Here is a compendium list (feel free others to contribute!) of advantages / disadvantages to using a custom Object instead of the standard Contact object:</p>\\n\\n<p>Advantages:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Data Model freedom: there are various restrictions on how you can related Standard Objects such as Contact to other objects. For instance, you cannot make Contact a Detail of a custom Master record --- Contacts can only be lookups. This, in turn, forces you to use Triggers to replicate the functionality that Roll-up Summary fields could provide if you were able to have a custom Master record of Contact (e.g. in your scenario \\'Team_<em>c\\' could be a Master object and \\'Coach</em>_c\\' could be the detail. This is not possible with Contacts/Accounts)</li>\\n<li>You escape the subtle, often frustrating linkages between the Account and Contact objects, e.g. the AccountId field, which always has to be populated (even if it\\'s with the mysterious 001000000000AAA Account), in order for Contact records to be shared with users other than the owner (without enabling View/Modify All Data on a non-Admin User\\'s Profile). Moreover, Contacts associated with an Account are always implicitly shared to Users who have access to the Account, which can be undesirable if you\\'re trying to use Contacts in a non-standard way. </li>\\n<li>Standard objects like Contact do not support Apex Managed Sharing --- probably not a big deal in your situation, but for ISV vendors this can be a real pain, forcing you to use \"Shadow\" Share objects to manage complex record-sharing scenarios.</li>\\n<li>You avoid certain License restrictions, e.g. as Peter Knolle mentioned the High Volume Customer Portal license can only CRU, but not Delete, Contact records. With Custom Objects, you have complete freedom over what Portal or Force.com Site users can do as far as Object/Field Permissions.</li>\\n<li>Users with a Salesforce Community License can add Attachments to Custom Objects. Community Licenses don\\'t let you add Attachments to certain standard objects, including Contact.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Disadvantages:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Only Leads and Contacts can be the targets of the \"Who\" (WhoId) field on Salesforce Activity records (Tasks and Events) </li>\\n<li>Email Templates, Programmatic Email messaging, and Workflow Email Messaging work very well with Leads and Contacts, not so well with Custom Objects. For instance, using Apex to set the related \"person\" on a Messaging.SingleEmailMessage requires use of the setTargetObjectId() method, which expects a Lead, User, or Contact Id --- custom objects are not supported. Similar difficulties crop up with Workflow Email messaging.</li>\\n<li>You can\\'t use the Social Contacts feature.</li>\\n<li>You can\\'t use some built-in Salesforce objects that relate to Contacts, e.g. AccountContactRole, OpportunityContactRole</li>\\n<li>Customer Portal functionality: Portal \"Users\" can be created easily from a Contact, as this is what Salesforce \"expects\" you to do. It\\'s more work to create them from Custom Objects.</li>\\n<li>As Peter Knolle has indicated, many AppExchange apps include functionality that builds off of standard objects, particularly the Contact and Account objects, so by migrating away from using the Contact object you would be limiting which apps you can use. Of course you in some cases you can build your own objects to match these, but this may chew through your objects limits (not to mention development time). Some examples of helpful apps that tie in to Contacts include:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Duplicate Prevention utilities</li>\\n<li>Nonprofit Template features, such as Relationships (Contact-to-Contact join) and Affiliations (Account-to-Contact join). </li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>You use up one of your Custom Objects. Can be a big deal in Group / Professional Edition.</li>\\n<li>Address fields. Moving away from Contact, you may have to recreate the Salesforce Mailing/Other Address field functionality, which is difficult to replicate exactly.</li>\\n<li>You remove yourself from the standard CRM Lead-to-Account/Contact/Opportunity conversion process. Can be a breath of fresh air if this is what you\\'re looking for, or a hassle.</li>\\n</ul>\\n'},\n",

This causes significant performance issues and thus increases time the unit tests run.

       "   'body': '<p>There\\'s not currently an easy way to upgrade your Cordova version within the Salesforce Hybrid SDK, as the current architecture has it embedded within the Hybrid SDK framework itself.  I would say, for practical purposes, that\\'s probably not the way to go at this point.  Let me speak to your second question.</p>\\n\\n<p>First, we are actively working towards being on the latest version of Cordova, in our next release.  Our tentative timeframe for this release will be early December.  In the meantime, however, we do all of our development against the public repo, in our <a href=\"https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS/tree/unstable\">unstable branch</a>(es).  So early drops of our work will be available there.</p>\\n\\n<p>Second, one of the reasons we\\'ve been working to get in sync with the latest version of Cordova is so that we can have a foundation for actively contributing changes back to <a href=\"http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/\">the Apache project</a>, rather than maintaining customizations within our own fork.  That said, we\\'ll probably still maintain our own fork of the main project, to allow for the intervening time between Apache commits and current customer requirements.  Moving forward, we will be doing our best to stay in sync with the latest versions of Cordova, as they move forward with their release cycle.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, in a Mobile SDK release down the road (probably a major revision for the Mobile SDK), we will be decoupling Cordova from the Hybrid SDK, allowing it to be a side-by-side first-class citizen/dependency with the SDK framework itself.  So in the future, Hybrid SDK consumers will be able to much more easily swap different versions of Cordova in and out of their own projects.  There will still exist the potential for version compatibility issues in that use case, but managing those dependencies will generally be a lot more manageable than it currently is.</p>\\n'}],\n",

For larger volumes, keep an eye on viewstate size (particularly if your page is interactive) and consider a paged approach to manage whats stored in it at any given time. Further than this you might want consider stateless pages utilising JavaScript Remoting or REST API.

Why not?</p>\\n\\n<p>This recently came up again in a question that I was working on answering, when that question was closed as a duplicate of this one.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to the methods already mentioned, it is possible to use <code>Test.loadData()</code> to create <code>&lt;obj name&gt;__History</code> records (this also works for history objects that don't have the <code>__History</code> suffix like <code>OpportunityFieldHistory</code>). At this time, the salesforce docs go back to API v30.0 (Spring '14), and I see <code>Test.loadData()</code> in the docs for that version. I haven't done a lot of searching/testing to see exactly when this became possible...but if you're reading this, then you should be able to use it.</p>\\n\\n<p>This requires a csv (comma-separated variable) file to be uploaded as a static resource. As far as I can tell, the only field of history objects that is absolutely required is the <code>ParentId</code> field. The advantage of this approach is that you are able to specify values for <code>OldValue</code> and <code>NewValue</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p>The following is an example using a custom object from my org, <code>Circuit__c</code>, with a custom field <code>Card__c</code>. The Id prefix for my object is <code>a0R</code>.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>ParentId,Field,OldValue,NewValue\\na0R000000000000,Card__c,123,456\\na0R000000000000,Card__c,456,abc\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Uploaded as a static resource named 'TestCircuitHistoryData', you would load it in a test like so</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>// Pretend that there's a test class definition out here somewhere...\\n@isTest\\nstatic void testLoadHistory(){\\n    // loadData takes 2 parameters, an SObject type, and the name of a static resource\\n    //   (as a string)\\n    List&lt;Circuit__History&gt; cs = Test.loadData(Circuit__History.SObjectType, 'TestCircuitHistoryData');\\n\\n    // When debugged, you can see that OldValue and NewValue are indeed populated\\n    system.debug(cs);\\n    // Rows of the CSV file are created/inserted top-down\\n    // 08:39:45:923 USER_DEBUG [15]|DEBUG|(Circuit__History:{Id=0170v00000KAxZxAAL, IsDeleted=false, ParentId=a0R000000000000EAA, CreatedById=null, CreatedDate=null, Field=Card__c, OldValue=123, NewValue=456}, Circuit__History:{Id=0170v00000KAxZyAAL, IsDeleted=false, ParentId=a0R000000000000EAA, CreatedById=null, CreatedDate=null, Field=Card__c, OldValue=456, NewValue=abc})\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>There are two big caveats with this approach:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>You'll probably need to use 'fake' Ids for the <code>ParentId</code> field. You could extract some actual history data from a production org, and put it in a csv file uploaded as a static resource...but that doesn't change the fact that the <code>ParentId</code> you have in your static resource will (practically speaking) never match the Id for records you'll create in a unit test.</li>\\n<li>The records that are loaded are inserted, and available through queries in a test method. However, the <code>OldValue</code> and <code>NewValue</code> fields will come back as <code>null</code> if you try to query them. <code>Test.loadData()</code> can only provide values to those fields in the 'in memory' instances that you get as a result of calling <code>Test.loadData()</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>That means that if you have logic that depends on the values stored in <code>OldValue</code> and/or <code>NewValue</code>, and you want to test it, the method you're trying to test would need to have its history data injected into it (as opposed to directly querying for it in the method). Data can be injected via static variables, class constructors, method parameters, etc... The important point is that you want to separate the job of fetching the data from the job of operating on it.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>// Testing this method using Test.loadData() is not possible because it depends on \\n//   OldValue/NewValue, and there is not a way to have those fields be anything other\\n//   than null (from a query) at time of writing\\npublic void directlyQueryHistory(){\\n    List&lt;Circuit__History&gt; chList = [SELECT Id, ParentId, Field, OldValue, NewValue FROM Circuit__History WHERE ParentId IN :myCircuits];\\n\\n    for(Circuit__History ch :chList){\\n        if(ch.Field == 'Special_Field__c' &amp;&amp; ch.OldValue != 'trouble'){\\n            // Do interesting things here\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// If we break the above method into two methods (both public, or at least @testVisible),\\n//   that will allow us to 'inject' test data, which will allow us to test logic that \\n//   depends on OldValue or NewValue.\\n// As is, there isn't much for us to test in this particular method (other than\\n//   making sure it gets called so it's marked as covered).\\npublic void QueryHistory(){\\n    List&lt;Circuit__History&gt; chList = [SELECT Id, ParentId, Field, OldValue, NewValue FROM Circuit__History WHERE ParentId IN :myCircuits];\\n    operateOnHistory(chList);\\n}\\n\\n// This method only cares about operating on data.\\n// It does not fetch (i.e. query) for anything on its own, everything it needs to \\n//   run needs to be set up for it by other code prior to running this method.\\n// Because the data is injected, we can use Test.loadData() in a unit test and have\\n//   OldValue available.\\npublic void operateOnHistory(List&lt;Circuit__History&gt; history){\\n    for(Circuit__History ch :history){\\n        if(ch.Field == 'Special_Field__c' &amp;&amp; ch.oldValue != 'trouble'){\\n            // Do interesting things here\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>An example test class (which makes some additional assumptions)</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>@isTest\\nprivate class HistoryTest{\\n    static List&lt;Circuit__History&gt; circuitHistory;\\n\\n    static void setup(){\\n        // This cannot be done inside a @testSetup method because static variables\\n        //   set in such a method are erased before each unit test is run\\n        circuitHistory = Test.loadData(Circuit__History.SObjectType, 'TestCircuitHistoryData');\\n    }\\n\\n    @isTest\\n    static void testLoadedHistory(){\\n         MyCircuitClass mcc = new MyCircuitClass();\\n\\n         // Operating on the Circuit History probably results in changes to\\n         //   those circuits (or changes on objects related to those circuits).\\n         // Thus, it's probably a good idea to make sure those object records exist\\n         Map&lt;Id, Circuit__c&gt; circuitsMap = new Map&lt;Id, Circuit__c&gt;();\\n         for(Circuit__History ch: circuitHistory){\\n             circuitsMap.put(ch.ParentId, new Circuit__c(Id = ch.ParentId));\\n         }\\n\\n         // We'll also likely need to inject these circuits to do anything useful.\\n         mcc.circuitsMap = circuitsMap;\\n\\n         test.startTest();\\n         mcc.operateOnHistory(circuitHistory);\\n         test.stopTest();\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\"},\n",

       "   'body': '<p>In the context of visualforce, to take advantage of the built-in features of Visualforce to access your org\\'s data, you <strong>must</strong> use a controller. All controllers are Apex classes, either standard Apex classes (ApexPages.StandardController or ApexPages.StandardSetController) or your own custom Apex class. You can also extend functionality of any of these with an Extension class. </p>\\n\\n<p>I tend to be a bit picky with my terminology here. Controllers are controllers. Extensions are not controllers. And for me, the difference is that extensions cannot live by themselves on a page. In other words, I\\'m not permitted to use extensions, unless my page has a controller in the first place. </p>\\n\\n<p>Another distinguishing feature is that a page is allowed only one controller ever. But I can add as many extensions as I need. </p>\\n\\n<p>So let me begin (what has become a dissertation) with controllers: </p>\\n\\n<p>Controllers are attached to your page using one of three mutually exclusive formats, standard controller, standard list/set controller, custom controller. </p>\\n\\n<p>For a page with a single record, accessing standard data and behavior of your object you would use standard controller: </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&lt;apex:page standardController=\"Account\"...&gt; ... &lt;/apex:page&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>If you want a page with many records, using standard list view, and list actions you could use standard list controller: </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&lt;apex:page standardController=\"Account\" recordsetVar=\"accountsList\"...&gt; ... &lt;/apex:page&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>If you want to use completely custom functionality and don\\'t really need most of the standard object behaviors, custom controller is a good option, but bear in mind, any standard actions you want to use will have to be implemented in your custom class. A page with a custom controller would use the following attribute: </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&lt;apex:page controller=\"MyApexClass\"...&gt; ... &lt;/apex:page&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>But bear in mind, you yourself can instantiate ApexPages.StandardController to use its features and functionality. I often use the pattern below to instantiate standard controller to get access to its methods: </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>public with sharing class MyApexClass {\\n  private ApexPages.StandardController ctrl;\\n  public Account acct {get;set;}\\n  public MyApexClass(){\\n    try{\\n      acct = [select Name from Account \\n          where Id = : ApexPages.currentPage().getParameters().get(\\'id\\')];\\n    } catch (QueryException e) {\\n      acct = new Account();\\n    }\\n      ctrl = new ApexPages.StandardController(acct);\\n  }\\n  public PageReference save(){\\n    //here I can put additional functionality or just leave it as-is.\\n    return ctrl.save();\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The above instantiates Standard Controller privately, but then surfaces a public save method that is just a pass-through of the controller\\'s save method. The constructor does the housekeeping of creating the actual record I\\'m working with. </p>\\n\\n<p>If I want to add to the functionality of any controller, I can then use an extension. Extensions work with either standard or custom controllers. Standard controller with custom extension, for me, is the most common construct I use for Visualforce that will operate inside my org. I get all the power of the standard controller, but all the flexibility of Apex. The syntax for an extension with a standard controller page would be as follows: </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&lt;apex:page standardController=\"account\" extensions=\"MyExtClass\"...&gt; ... &lt;/apex:page&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The extension class is then required to implement a constructor that accepts the type of the controller. You will then typically want to get a handle to the standard controller instance that is floating around, and the sObject instance that it represents. So for a standard controller page: </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>public with sharing class MyExtClass {\\n  private ApexPages.StandardController ctrl;\\n  public Account acct {get;set;}\\n  public MyExtClass(ApexPages.StandardController controllerParam){\\n      ctrl = controllerParam;\\n      acct = (Account) ctrl.getRecord();\\n  }\\n  public PageReference customsave(){\\n    //here I override my standard save functionality before I return the save call.\\n    return ctrl.save();\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>With a custom controller and extension, you can probably extrapolate from the above, but just to close the loop. </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&lt;apex:page controller=\"MyApexClass\" extensions=\"MyExtClass\"...&gt; ... &lt;/apex:page&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Again, the extension class implements a constructor that accepts the type of the controller, only now it is my custom class. From there, apart from getting a local handle to your custom controller instance, there isn\\'t a pattern, per-se, but the local handle allows you to interact directly with your custom controller, in whatever way necessary, of course. : </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>public with sharing class MyExtClass {\\n  private MyApexClass ctrl;\\n  public MyExtClass(MyApexClass controllerParam){\\n      ctrl = controllerParam;\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>There are additional tricks that are very powerful, such as instantiating ApexPages.StandardSetController in your class to take advantage of that class\\' built-in paging, features. For more on that, there is a great video from Dreamforce 11 that shows how this can work: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/Js00YUpJAjs\">http://youtu.be/Js00YUpJAjs</a></p>\\n'},\n",

Instead they would use a combination of <code>developer organization</code> (essentially these are sandboxes for development and testing of code). Salesforce <em>also</em> has the idea of an actual salesforce <code>sandbox</code> which is a copy of a production/paid Salesforce org. that contains the data/source-code customizations (apex classes etc.) of it's parent and can be easily merged to the parent. Depending on the types of testing data, I would still recommend using <em>developer orgs</em> for each individual developer and migrating them to a single <em>developer org</em> before deployment. However, this goes more to the question of if you are developing an application that might need to be used by others.</p></li>\\n<li><p>You will need licenses for each <code>user</code> that wants to fetch data from an API call to a single production org. That being said, if your application only needs to access one set of data from a production org, than only one user license could typically be used to access all the data on the org if it is given the right permissions. Developers could develop against a 'test set' of that data.</p></li>\\n<li><p>No, you can create and reuse as many developer orgs as you need. They have limitations on how much data you can store, so if you have issues building your test data into development orgs you might want to consider using sandboxes, or becoming a <em>partner</em>, and salesforce can help you address your individual needs.</p></li>\\n<li><p>You can <em>reuse</em> development orgs as much or as little as you need. I have created hundreds for examples from doing everything from little experiments to full on development cycles.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Salesforce is kind of confusing about the way attribute <code>3rd party</code> data access so to speak, so I would look to various applications like 'Customer Portal' that work via the Salesforce application infrastructure. If your planning on giving 3rd parties access to their data (some of which is hosted on Salesforce) for security consideration they should have SFDC licenses, logins, etc. But it's also possible that you could use a go-between hosted service and fetch data as needed from Salesforce. Security is def. a serious issue in that arena though, so keep that in mind, once the data has left Salesforce your responsible for what happens to it, for better or worse.</p></li>\\n<li><p>See my answer to question 4. <strong>Edit</strong> With the <code>go-between</code> service, I'd say that users whom don't need to access data on a Salesforce org wouldn't need credentials unless you patched them through to some sort of shared dataset and than you would need at least one login.</p></li>\\n<li><p>See previous answers, depending on how you want to manage and organize data on Salesforce, an individual Salesforce user account can do a lot.

If you have two classes that need to be deleted at the same time, you can simply add another  row into the file with the name of the other class, for example:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\\n\\n&lt;Package xmlns=\"http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata\"&gt;\\n\\n&lt;types&gt;\\n\\n&lt;members&gt;SomeClass&lt;/members&gt;\\n\\n&lt;members&gt;SomeOtherClass&lt;/members&gt;\\n\\n&lt;name&gt;ApexClass&lt;/name&gt;\\n\\n&lt;/types&gt;\\n\\n&lt;version&gt;30.0&lt;/version&gt;\\n\\n&lt;/Package&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<ol start=\"4\">\\n<li><p>Save this file name as destructiveChanges.xml (note the capital ‘C’ in ‘changes’).

Open the folder, select both the XML files, right-click and select ‘Send To > Compressed Folder’. Keeping the default name of ‘package’ for the folder is fine.</p></li>\\n<li><p>You are now setup to deploy the destructiveChanges.xml file to Salesforce. To do this, go to Workbench and login with your credentials. It is recommended that you login to a Sandbox instance before you deploy the file to production.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Select Migration > Deploy.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Click ‘Browse’ and select the .zip package file. Then check ‘Rollback on Error’, ‘Single Package’, and select Test Level with ‘RunLocalTests’.

       "   'body': '<p>Licenses are associated with individual users and make functionality available.  For example,  a Salesforce license has access to the sales cloud functionality (Leads, Opportunities) that a platform license doesn\\'t.  There are also feature licenses that can be applied to a user to add functionality.  For example, Mobile User is a feature license that allows a user with an existing license to use Salesforce Mobile.  There are many other licenses available and it can get rather bewildering at times, especially as the license names change on occasion. </p>\\n\\n<p>A Salesforce edition is the \"type\" (for want of a better work) of your Salesforce instance.  The edition determines:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>What functionality is available - e.g. contact manager edition doesn\\'t have opportunities</li>\\n<li>The limits - of which there are many - the maximum number of custom objects, the maximum number of tabs, the maximum number of custom fields.  </li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>To add to this, some limits are a based on a combination of edition and user license.  Data storage, for example, is 20Mb per licensed user on Enterprise Edition, but 120Mb per licensed user on Unlimited Edition.</p>\\n\\n<p>With regard to different licenses per edition, yes there would be a different cost, but it would still be based on the edition.  Thus you couldn\\'t mix Enterprise and Unlimited licenses in Unlimited Edition.  Every user must have a license appropriate for the edition, and these get more expensive as the capability of the edition increases.  </p>\\n\\n<p>If you are considering multiple editions of Salesforce in a single organisation, you can create a salesforce app and deploy it to each edition. If you need the same data across all editions you\\'d need to look at Salesforce 2 Salesforce to replicate the data, which brings a few challenges of its own.  For multi-edition you\\'d need to consider:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Reporting - there won\\'t be a single view of all the data available</li>\\n<li>Collaboration - as chatter is tied to a single edition, only users in that edition will be able to collaborate unless you set up multiple logins per user</li>\\n<li>Governance - if there is any common functionality you will have to replicate that across all editions </li>\\n<li>License costs - any users that need access to more than one edition will need a license for each</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Multi-edition does have some advantages though:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Security and visibility - if you have complex requirements in this area it can be difficult to model and maintain in a single edition </li>\\n<li>Capacity and performance - the edition limits are multiplied by the number of editions, so you can have more custom applications, objects, tabs etc.  Plus your data will be split across multiple editions which will scale better for large data volumes</li>\\n<li>Innovation - if you have complex customisations across a number of business units it can be difficult to make changes in a rapid fashion due to the need to test for all scenarios</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The way I normally approach this is to start with a single edition and whenever a new business area comes on board, evaluate whether its better for them to share the existing edition or use one of their own.</p>\\n'}],\n",

So couple of options...</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p><strong>Action Override for Clone.</strong> What you have here, is basically a client process requirement your trying to deal with at the database level. Which is causing some design side effects. Though in fairness we often consider these routes, due to the fact that there is no 'process' entry point to the client logic in Salesforce. While not 100% bullet proof (for example SObject.clone), you can in fact get close enough via an override of the Clone action on your Custom Object under the 'Standard Buttons and Links' section. This way you could implement a VF page to display just what you need and override the StandardController save method to clear the fields you don't. Leaving all other contexts intact and no need for the trigger, leaving your Data Loading experience as expected.</p></li>\\n<li><p><strong>Control Field.</strong> is to continue with the route you have taken, that in my view is also not so bad. The trick to making it feel better is the naming and meaning of the field, ideally something users and devs will relate to in relation to the other fields it effects. So called <em>'control fields'</em> serve only to adjust the behaviour of triggers. These typically default (via the field definition) to the most commonly desired behaviour. Thus in the majority of use cases (UI, API's etc) where your records are created or updated, they need not be considered by the user or developer. It is also good practice user experience wise (if your use case allows it) to throw validation errors if the trigger logic senses fields with values set or contain certain values that disagree with the 'control' fields indicated behaviour. </p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>If you go for 2, I would invert the meaning of your control field, e.g. 'Clear None Cloneable Fields'. Default it to False in the field definition. From a UI perspective place it in a section with the fields it effects near the top (or hide it as you wish). In your trigger, if it's false, then flip it during the on before insert, so that it becomes set to true by the time the record is eventually saved. Later as users attempt to Clone records created this way, it will be carried forward and fire your logic.</p>\\n\\n<p>Tricky stuff though to design, general rule of thumb is know and test all your use cases, typically all the UI actions / operations and CRUD combinations (you don't have to test multiple SF API routes here, Data Loader or even DML in tests will do). Enjoy!</p>\\n\\n<p>P.S. If you want to try 1 and need an example let me know, I'll update answer.</p>\\n\"},\n",
